This repository contains the scripts used to generate the Octopus guides.

See the aspnet-azuredevops-artifactory-feed-azurewebsite-tfvc-video.yml file for a commented example.

To write the scripts in IntelliJ, reference the JAR file created by the project at https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/WebDriverTraining. 
IntelliJ can extract the Cucumber step definitions and use them to validate the feature files.
